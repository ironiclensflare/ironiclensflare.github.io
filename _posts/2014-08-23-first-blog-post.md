Coding
------

It has been a busy few weeks of coding. In my quest to find gainful
employment as a web developer, I have been spending a lot of time preparing
something that resembles a portfolio to help me out.

I've been working on a series of ASP.NET projects for the experience more than
anything else. On a bit of a whim I ended up downloading the [GPS Logger for
Android][1] app and, seeing that one of its features allows you to regularly
push GPS data to a web service, I decided to create a [rudimentary track logging
web app][2] for it.

The [Google Maps API][3] is something I had previously never used before,
although I had been looking for a good reason to. With a little poking about, I
had it plotting my recorded tracks on a map and telling me (somewhat
pointlessly) where I had been that day.


Social
------

I quit Facebook several years ago, mostly on account of the social element of
it. It started out all fun and exciting as a way of keeping in touch with former
colleagues when my place of work at the time dissolved. It was only when it
became a public forum for said colleagues' failing marriages, descents into
depression and generally far more information than I wanted to know that I
deleted my account for good.

My current job requires that I regularly use Facebook, albeit for purely
professional purposes. In a bizarre moment I found myself vaguely missing it, so
that lunchtime I attempted to craft an alter ego in order to give it a second
shot. I don't know whether it was the fact I was using a VPN or that Facebook
just didn't believe my name was Nigel Clarke, but my attempt was outright
refused unless I gave Mr Zuckerberg my phone number. I declined.

That was more than enough to convince me that Facebook is still a place I do not
want to share an iota of my data with. It was at that point that a colleague
suggested I take a look at [Diaspora][4]. I had vague recollections of seeing
that name before on Kickstarter, but had probably just assumed it was doomed to
failure like so much of the other stuff on there. As they put it:

> "Diaspora is the social network that puts you in control of your information.
> You decide what youâ€™d like to share, and with whom. You retain full ownership of
> all your information, including friend lists, messages, photos, and profile
> details."

I've liked the idea of decentralised social networks ever since I heard about
[Tent][5] a couple of years ago. The problem I had with Tent was that I only
ever came across about five people who were actively using is, and all they
seemed to do was talk about Tent. Kind of like CB radio. Nonetheless, I signed
up for an account on the [diasp.eu][6] *pod* and made a post.

So far that's all I've done, but if you fancy following me on Diaspora, feel
free to [come and find me][7].
