Here is some paragraph text. As you can see it is wrapping correctly
at about 80 characters.

Now to look at bulleted lists:

   * This is my first bullet point. As you can see it is indented a
     little ways, but by the looks of things it is working just fine.

   * Here is another bullet point. Once again, it appears to be
     wrapping correctly.

And now for some numbered lists:

   1. This is my first bullet point
   
   2. This is my second numbered point. You can see how it wraps
      correctly using `filladapt-mode`.

   3. One more for good luck.

That is all
