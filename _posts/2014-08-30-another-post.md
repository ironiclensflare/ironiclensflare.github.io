Here is some paragraph text. As you can see it is wrapping correctly
at about 80 characters.

Now to look at bulleted lists:

   * This is my first bullet point. As you can see it is indented a
     little ways, but by the looks of things it is working just fine.

   * Here is another bullet point. Once again, it appears to be
     wrapping correctly.

And finally some more text.

	1. The same applies for numbers also. In this case, here is a
	   numbered list that wraps in the same way that the bulleted ones
	   do.

	2. Bullet point number 2.

That about wraps up the markdown thing.
